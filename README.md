# Preface
**Motivation**  
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early and accurate detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes.

**Problem Statement**  
We aim to explore optimal neural network architectures, fine-tune training parameters, ensure interpretability, and refine preprocessing methods—addressing COPD-specific challenges while balancing classification performance with clinical transparency.

**Approach**  
This project compares multiple architectures (CNN variants, vision transformer networks, etc.) to determine the best-performing model for COPD classification. Interpretability techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM, Occlusion Sensitivity) are also employed to clarify how each model reaches its decisions.
